# Course development proposal:  a new introduction to Greek

### Overview

We propose a reimagining of our department's introductory sequence in ancient Greek founded on four ideas:

- The course coordinates in-class curriculum with a community-based learning component to connect students' study of Greek with their lived experience.
- Students engage with an authentic text from the first day of the course, and read increasingly extensive continuous unaltered selections.
- Our pedagogy is guided by contemporary research in second language acquisition, so that frequent, unfamiliar or inherently complex topics in the target language appear early in the year.
- Computational analysis of the central text allows us to organize both in-class curricular material and themes for CBL work based on its content.

### Why introductory Greek now?

Greek 101-102 is a crucial sequence for our majors.  Virtually none of our students arrive at Holy Cross with prior study of Greek, so Greek 101-102 is the first step towards required courses at intermediate or advanced levels. 

Across the college, we are currently debating how to redesign our common requirements, at the same time that remote teaching has compelled us to reflect on what is essential to our pedagoy. The Classics Department has been working for several years to update our language pedagogy, and to put in the foreground of all our courses questions about diversity and inclusion, and how the study of the ancient Mediterranean world helps us better understand contemporary issues.  We need to align our teaching of this crucial introductory sequence with college-wide and departmental goals.

Both of us are involved in our department's multi-year initiative, supported by the Scholarship in Action program, to rework our Latin curriculum.  This initiative is a model for integrating CBL work into beginning language courses while addressing long-standing pedagogical issues in the teaching of historical languages. It is an opportune moment for us to bring that experience to bear on beginning Greek.
 

### New pedagogy and how it enhances teaching / learning

Introductory courses in Greek have broadly followed one of two approaches. The "grammar/translation" method tends to introduce features of the language as though  systematically progressing through a reference grammar, without regard for what features actually appear together, or what features would enable students to read an authentic text. The "comprehensible input" (or CI) method more closely mimics natural processes of language acquisition by presenting texts that gradually extend the student's knowledge of the language with unfamiliar constructions and vocabulary. Curricula for comprehensive input teaching of Greek and Latin, however, have achieved this by composing artificial texts to teach from. Both approaches contradict a fundamental goal of our pedagogy: to take authentic ancient texts seriously, as a way of reflecting on and understanding our own experience.

Our proposal differs in two ways: (1) we apply CI methods to authentic texts, and (2) we incorporate community engagement in the course.

#### 1. A curriculum from authentic texts

As we have learned from our new introductory Latin curriculum, computational textual analysis makes it possible to achieve the benefits of the comprehensible input approach using authentic texts. Research on second-language acquisition has shown that beginning language courses should sequence topics to introduce frequent, unfamiliar or inherently complex topics early.  We first analyze the target corpus to determine precisely what grammatical features and vocabulary appear both how often: this lets us determine an appropriate sequence. Then, rather than composing fictional texts to fit a preconceived series of topics, we algorithmically identify sections of the target text using these features, and only features already introduced. In this way, we present contextualized, comprehensible sections of the target text. In effect, we allow the demands of the authentic Greek texts to dictate our teaching agenda. 

#### 2. CBL component

In weekly lab sections, students will explore more deeply connections between their language study and contemporary society. For example, as students learn about Greek's active, passive and  middle(!) voice, we will look at how recent newspaper headlines covering Black Lives Matter protests use voice to express or mask agency and responsibility.  For our target text, we have selected Lysias' first oration, a classical Athenian defense speech in a murder case.  The characters in the trial come from all levels of Athenian society. In our experience teaching with Lysias 1 in other Greek courses, this oration has challenged students to profound reflection on their own place in a society with marked social inequities.

Lysias 1 is also an invitation to think about legal and social structures, and their relation to justice.  As it was in classical Athens, decision-making by jury is a communal process today, and we want those dynamics reflected through conversations with our local community.  A major focus of their CBL work will be developing and implementing programming for events hosted by partners in the community.  During summer 2021, we will begin outreach to potential partners, including the Worcester Public Library, the Worcester Art Museum, and the American Antiquarian Society.  In consultation with these partners, we will develop the structure of these public conversations that our students will help plan and facilitate.  We hope to schedule one to two public events per semester.


### Main learning goals


1. Read an unaltered court speech of the orator Lysias in ancient Greek, using knowledge of the morphology, syntax, and vocabulary of the target text.
2. Given a passage of Greek, identify features of the language, including grammatical constructions, and find multiple ways to express those ideas in English.  Recognize how the process of translation necessitates interpretive choices and explain one’s own decisions.
3. Express the content of a paragraph of written English in Attic Greek.  Recognize how the process of composition necessitates interpretive choices and explain one’s own decisions.
4.  Identify and define the features of Athenian forensic speech within its historical context. Relate Athenian legal practice to today's American judicial system.


## Assessment

Course work is organized in a series modules.  Each module will include four kinds of assessment corresponding to the four primariy learning goals.

1. Short quizzes on Greek morphology, syntax, vocabulary, to put new knowledge into practice immediately. 
2. Translation: analyze a continuous passage of Greek, express its content in English, and explain translator’s choices.
3. Composition: compose a continuous passage of Attic Greek expressing the content of an English paragraph, and explain the composer's choices.
4. Reflective exercises considering both new material and CBL activities in relation to contemporary lived experience, with special consideration of the relationship between language and social structure.



### Outline of work planned for  summer, 2021

Our plans for a complete 101-102 course sequence are too ambitious to complete in one summer. In the summer of 2021, we will begin to develop relations with community partners for the CBL component of the course, and will complete an initial computational analysis of Lysias.  Together, these will allow us to develop first drafts of curricular modules for Greek 101 and the accompanying fall-semester CBL lab.  We will outline plans for a spring semester Greek 102 course and CBL lab.  We expect to have a fuller spring semester curriculum ready before offering the revised course for the first time in F22.  We plan to make all of our course material freely available on github so that others can use or modify it for teaching Greek beyond Holy Cross.
