# Course development proposal:  a new introduction to Greek

### Overview

We propose a reimagining of our department's introductory sequence in ancient Greek founded on four ideas:

- The course coordinates in-class curriculum with a community-based learning component to connect students' study of Greek with their lived experience.
- Students engage with an authentic text from the first day of the course, and read increasingly extensive continuous unaltered selections.
- Our pedagogy is guided by contemporary research in second language acquisition, so that frequent, unfamiliar or inherently complex topics in the target language appear early in the year.
- Computational analysis of the central text allows us to organize both in-class curricular material and themes for CBL work based on its content.

### Why now?

Key points:
- contemporary national/international context: misappropriation of ancient Greek language and culture to buttress extreme political agendas. Urgent that students be equipped to challenge false claims, and understand how study of (upper-case C) Classics has historically been deployed both to reinforce structures of power, and to resist them.
- context at Holy Cross: align beginning Greek (required for major) with department-wide pedagogical goals; build on ongoing discussion of college-wide common requirements
 -The reimagined approach addresses some long standing issues in classical language pedagogy. The grammar/translation method assumes a lot of background in language learning because students need to absorb whole systems (though they don't use the whole system equally), so this approach can be exclusionary. Bringing actual texts in from the beginning avoids the enrollment chasm between intro and intermediate, which helps students stay longer in the language and develop deeper knowledge, greater confidence, and closer contact with an ancient language and its culture.
- experience with remote learning in 2020-2021: we can draw on experience with flipped-classroom and asynchronous activities to support language learning (such as interactive Observable notebooks)
- Latin Scholarship in Action project: similar goals, and a practical model for part of our work
### New pedagogy and how it enhances teaching / learning
Introductory courses in Greek (as in Latin) have broadly followed one of two approaches. The "grammar/translation" method tends to introduce features of the language as though you were systematically progressing through a reference grammar, without regard for what features actually appear together, or what features are sufficient to be able to read an authentic text. The "comprehensible input" (or CI) method more closely mimics natural processes of language acquisition by presenting texts that gradually extend the student's knowledge of the language with unfamiliar constructions and vocabulary. Curricula for comprehensive input teaching of Greek and Latin, however, have achieved this by composing artificial texts or novellas to teach from, and [in my experience] do not prepare students to read authentic texts at the college level within an academic year.
#### Computational analysis of authentic Greek
Both these approaches contradict a fundamental goal of our pedagogy: to
take ancient texts seriously, as a way of reflecting on and understanding

 our own experience. Like the parallel project in the Classics Department reshaping our introductory Latin curriculum, our project recognizes the benefits of the comprehensible input approach, but uses computational analysis of real texts to present beginning students with staged passages of authentic Greek. Rather than composing fictional texts to fit a preconceived series of topics, we sequence our topics based around comprehensible sections of the text we identify algorithmically. That is, we allow the demands of the authentic Greek texts to dictate our teaching agenda. For example, both grammar/translation and CI methods typically begin by teaching students verbs in the present tense, in the indicative ("fact-telling") mood, in all three persons ("I", "you", "he/she/it/they"). This might be followed later by future and past tenses of the indicative. But this is not what we find in actual Greek texts.
We can read extended sections of narrative by starting with past tenses of the indicative in the third person only. Soon after, we add the third person forms of the other moods of the verb that Greek uses frequently (the subjunctive and optative). Students are quickly able to work with continuous passages of real Greek texts.
#### CBL component
Key points:
- lab component required part of course
- from first day of course, consider relation of study of Classics to structures of power
- developing community partners in summer 2021
- once per semester or so, students help facilitate events with Greekless public
- focusing on Lysias 1 in first cycle of course: raises questions about legal system and social structures and their relation to justice; highlights some popularly neglected aspects of participatory democracy [we tend to think a lot about voting and not as much about jury duty and jury selection]

 -[here’s some copy I wrote up earlier, far too long for here, but perhaps worth saving for the SIA grant later:] The emotional and legal stakes of the dispute remain accessible even today. At the heart of the trial lies the question, when is murder justifiable? Answering the question will require investigating how Athenian law treats violent acts of revenge; gender roles and the arrangement of the household; the relationship between private family and public society; and the treatment of enslaved persons within the household and in court.
As students read the speech closely and engage with its arguments, they step into the role of member of the Athenian jury. By requiring critical analysis, response to rhetorical strategies, and evaluation of the implementation of justice, the speech develops skills that students need for a contemporary American civic obligation: jury duty. The right to a jury trial is guaranteed in the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights, a right that can be traced through England’s Magna Carta back to the jury trials of ancient Athens, where speeches like Lysias’ were read aloud. Lysias’ speech allows students to learn the details of earlier antecedents to our own system, highlighting similarities to and differences with the practices of today’s judicial system. As our society has been convulsed by loud debates about who holds the right to use lethal force and how that use of force is held accountable, the need for a deep, critical, historically-informed understanding of the American justice system has never been clearer.
Decision-making by jury is a communal process today, and we want those dynamics reflected through conversations with our local community. During summer 2021, we propose to begin outreach to potential community partners who would host conversations about the issues described above, e.g., the Worcester Public Library, the Worcester Art Museum, etc. etc. We will develop the structure of these conversations in consultation with these partners. One idea is to have students lead an interactive conversation that places different parts of the audience in the roles of plaintiff (Eratosthenes’ family), defendant (Euphiletos), jury, and other people involved in the lawsuit (the wife, the enslaved woman, Euphiletos’

 friend), giving voice to those who do not speak in our text, but whose perspective and witness are keys to the implementation of justice.
### Learning goals
Reading an unaltered court speech of the orator Lysias in ancient Greek,
students will:
- identify Greek grammatical constructions and find multiple ways to express those ideas in English
- recognize choices they must make in translating, and how any translation loses part of what the original text conveys
- interpret unfamiliar vocabulary by using specific context of the passage and using standard scholarly tools such as Liddell-Scott's Greek Lexicon
- relate the rhetorical form of the speech to Athenian legal practice
- identify specific points of similarity and difference between the functions of legal rhetoric in classical Athens and rhetoric in contemporary legal cases
- identify the basic components of an Athenian forensic speech and be able to define them [since we’ve already used the terms proem and narratio in our conversation]
## Assessment
We plan to assess language skills that have been the focus of introductory language courses in the past, as well as how the course has affected students' understanding of larger course goals. Assessment will include:
- regular reflective exercises
- language skills assessed through analysis/composition assignments typically accessible only to students in intermediate or advanced Greek courses

-a word study/lexicography assignment or exercise where they trace a significant root through various noun/adjective/verb formations, perhaps a thematically important word like dikē, and analyze the compounds as they arise?
### Outline of work planned for  summer, 2021
In the summer of 2021, we hope to:
- develop relations with community partners for the CBL component of the course
- complete initial computational analysis of the target text
This will lead to initial drafts of curricular modules for a two-semester Greek 101-102 sequence comprising:
- presentation of language features
- reading selections in Lysias illustrating language features in this unit - exercises that students can use asynchronously or that teachers can use in class to practice new language features
- assignments requiring students to relate material in this module to contemporary issues of relevance to them
